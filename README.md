# Baraka (بركة)

An offline-first, bilingual (English/Arabic) mobile app that helps Muslims set and renew a conscious intention (niyyah) before daily activities — prayer, eating, work, sleep — turning routine moments into acts of worship. Every intention is backed by a verified, canonical hadith reference; nothing is included on a weak or fabricated source.

## Overview

Many daily routines can feel mundane, but in Islamic tradition they become acts of worship through a sincere, conscious intention. Baraka gives that intention structure: role-based niyyah suggestions (parent, student, professional, homemaker), a daily renewal flow, reflection journaling, and a streak/reward system — entirely offline, fully bilingual with real RTL support, and content-audited against canonical sources rather than generic self-help copy.

It's also a live case study in migrating a shipped, published app's entire data layer without losing a single user's history — see [ARCHITECTURE.md's Notable Engineering Problems](./ARCHITECTURE.md#notable-engineering-problems) for what that actually involved.

## Features

- **Role-based niyyah suggestions.** Intention options tailored to parent, student, professional, and homemaker roles, so the same activity surfaces different, relevant niyyah text per role.
- **17 daily activities** spanning prayer, eating, work, exercise, sleep, and more, each backed by a verified, canonical hadith reference.
- **Daily renewal flow.** A deliberate "set your intention" step before each activity, with a disclaimer that niyyah lives in the heart, not the tongue.
- **Streak tracking with an ajr (reward) multiplier**, strict by design. Missing a day resets the streak.
- **Optional 9 PM streak-risk reminder.** If nothing's been completed by then, you're notified before the day is lost. It stays armed a day ahead so it still fires even if you don't reopen the app.
- **A single daily reminder** at a time you choose, with a contextual permission flow, instead of per-activity notification spam.
- **Reflection journaling** with search and filtering across past entries.
- **Custom activities and custom niyyah options** to extend the built-in set with your own.
- **Fully offline.** No network dependency for core functionality.
- **Bilingual EN/AR with real RTL support**, enforced as the default experience rather than bolted on.

## Architecture Highlights

Full reasoning and the complete bug writeups live in **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**. Short version:

- **SQLite (expo-sqlite) + Drizzle ORM**, not Realm (deprecated by MongoDB in 2024) or WatermelonDB (built for sync/scale this app doesn't need) — chosen for real relational integrity (explicit foreign keys) over the static-array model it replaced.
- **A real `useLiveQuery` gotcha**: it only subscribes to a query's `FROM` table, not anything `leftJoin`-ed in — found when activity toggles silently stopped updating the UI.
- **Async local reads still need a loading state**: `useLiveQuery` seeds `[]` before resolving, so "loading" and "genuinely empty" look identical without an explicit signal — solved with `updatedAt`-gated skeleton loaders instead of spinners or blank screens.
- **Arabic is the enforced default**, regardless of device locale, with full RTL layout — including a real bug where a manual RTL animation compensation clamped the first onboarding screen to invisible.
- **A legacy-data migration bug found by self-audit**, not a bug report: journal entries and daily logs had no backfill path from the old storage, meaning upgrading users would have silently lost their history.
- **Sentry tuned for a free-tier quota** — breadcrumbs/tags/context are free and used liberally; exception/message capture reserved for real events.
- **Every niyyah traces to a canonical, verified hadith reference** — no weak or fabricated sources, even if it means cutting a feature.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | React Native, Expo SDK 54, Expo Router v4, TypeScript |
| Data (content + user data) | expo-sqlite + Drizzle ORM, reactive via `useLiveQuery` |
| Data (settings only) | Zustand + MMKV |
| Animation | React Native Reanimated 4, RN Gesture Handler |
| Localization | i18next / react-i18next, full RTL support |
| Observability | Sentry (breadcrumbs, tags, context, quota-aware error capture) |
| Notifications | expo-notifications |
| UI | Custom design-token system (spacing/radius/typography), `AnimatedPressable`, `@gorhom/bottom-sheet`, Feather icons |
| Testing | Jest, targeted at migrations, streak computation, notifications, date/id utilities |
| Tooling | Bun |

## Data Model

Core tables: `categories`, `activities`, `niyyah_options`, `niyyah_profile_tags`, `niyyah_sources`, `learn_content`, `content_meta`, `user_activity_prefs`, `custom_activities`, `custom_niyyah_options`, `daily_logs`, `daily_log_niyyahs`, `journal_entries`.

Content tables (`activities`, `niyyah_options`, `learn_content`, etc.) are wiped and re-seeded on content-version bumps; user tables are never touched by seeding. `niyyah_sources` exists ahead of use — the schema already supports layering Qur'an/athar/scholar citations alongside a hadith reference, for a planned multi-source evidencing feature.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and Bun
- Android Studio (emulator) or a physical device for `expo-dev-client` — this app uses native modules (SQLite, notifications) that need a custom dev client, not plain Expo Go

### Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ammarahmed1263/Baraka.git
cd Baraka
bun install
bunx expo run:android   # or: bunx expo run:ios
```

### Useful scripts

```bash
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm test            # jest
npm run db:studio   # inspect the local SQLite DB via Drizzle Studio
bunx expo prebuild --clean   # after any native config change
```

## Roadmap

What's already built is covered above in [Overview](#overview) and [Architecture Highlights](#architecture-highlights) — including the two production incidents (boot-race and legacy-migration data loss) that were root-caused and fixed post-launch, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md#notable-engineering-problems). What's ahead:

- [ ] Per-activity reminders and prayer-time auto-detection (v2)
- [ ] Multi-source niyyah evidencing (Qur'an/athar/scholar citations alongside hadith — data model already in place)
- [ ] More content — additional verified activities and learn/niyyah entries
- [ ] Native Android widgets
- [ ] In-app feedback channel
- [ ] Basic user insights (streak trends, completion history)
- [ ] CSV/PDF export
- [ ] ESLint + Prettier + pre-commit enforcement
- [ ] OTA updates via EAS Update, so JS-only fixes don't wait on a full store review

Open gaps tracked deliberately rather than hidden: see [ARCHITECTURE.md's Open Gaps](./ARCHITECTURE.md#open-gaps).
